# World Bank Western Kenya CDD and Flood Mitigation Project

## Project Background and Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to support the Government of Kenya (GoK) in the development a citizen-driven, ICT-enabled system for enhancing Western Kenya CDD and Flood Mitigation Project monitoring and supervision at the sub-county and community level and governance at the community level. 
The process aims to:

1. Enhance the ability to monitor, compare and disseminate sub-projects/sub-locations results-based framework
performance, link performance to funding and analyze beneficiary details (male/female, absolute poor, etc.); 
1.  Improve social accountability measures at the community level to ensure that community leaders are held accountable by community members.
1. Roll out a strategy to make the existing mapping mechanism a living system that is embedded in project implementation and that can self sustained by project teams. The ICT tools used should be built on a technology platform that takes advantage of the existing online mapping platform employed by the project, and that, to the extent possible, interfaces with (and does not duplicate) the project’s management information system.

The intermediate objectives are to:

* Adapt functionality of existing digital maps to include results. 
* Develop a mobile or tablet based, open source, crowd-sourcing mechanism that allows designated CDDC representatives to track and report results as well as funding levels received.
* Transfer capacity through training for maintaining and updating map information.

The system and ICT tools are to be developed in participatory design process working directly with the local project counterparts. While general initial requirements are laid out in this document, it is expected that the design process coupled with an agile software development approach will lead to the specific requirements of the final functioning system and ICT tool.


## SCOPE OF WORK 

The Western Kenya Community Driven Development and Flood Mitigation Project became effective on 7th August 2007 and is being implemented by the Ministry of State for Special Programmes, now in its 5th year of implementation.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to empower local communities to engage in wealth creating activities, lower the incidence of poverty and reduce the vulnerability of the poor to adverse effects associated with recurrent flooding. 

The PDO will be achieved through key outcomes namely:
* Empowered communities that can manage their own development in a sustainable and socially inclusive manner.
* Reduced vulnerability of the community to adverse outcomes associated with recurrent flooding.
* Ensured smooth implementation of the project. 

The project has three components through which activities are implemented. 

These include:
* Community Driven Development
* Flood Mitigation
* Implementation Support

The project is being implemented in 5 Counties (Vihiga, Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia and Siaya) that constitute 10 sub-counties (formerly District Coordinating units DCUs).

In order to facilitate this process, the Government of Kenya, with World Bank support, geo-mapped all of the sub-projects in the WKCDD and featured the map on the project website.  Each of the 350+ sub-projects is depicted on a web-based map.  Click on the dot representing a sub-project, and then a person viewing the map can see the sub-project name, category, funding, and contact information. The mapping platform also has the capability to include photos and videos of each sub-project, and the project is in the process of capturing and uploading these.

The objective of the mapping work initially was to map the locations, activities, funding of sub-projects to enhance performance, transparency, and citizen participation as well as to test an enhanced model of project supervision.
The mapping initiative is part of a broader effort by the GOK and World Bank to enhance governance in Kenya projects involving decentralized expenditures in communities and service facilities, partly in response to issues that have arisen in audits conducted by the Government of Kenya on several local level development projects. The WKCDD project experience shows that mapping can be done efficiently and at high quality by the Government project team itself, even with limited resources. More than 90% of the sub-projects have been mapped. Drawing on technical assistance provided by the WB social accountability team and WBI’s Mapping for Results initiative, WKCDD project team members visited each sub-project, gathered basic geo-coordinates and categories, uploaded the information onto a map over the course of 2-3 weeks in the fall of 2011. They used motor bikes to transverse into villages. This reduced the costs further.

By making small sub-projects more visible, mapping not only can enhances transparency and monitoring of funds, but it can also improve project impact.. Mapping also makes it possible to easily see the spatial distribution of all the sub-projects in a specific category (e.g., bee-keeping, dairy, fish farming), which in turn can enable more strategic deployment of extension and marketing services. This also opens the door for more targeted information sharing and competition between sub-projects in a particular sub-category. 

Further work is underway to embed geo-mapping into the fabric of the WKCDD project, by linking it to the project’s management information system and to project team responsibilities, and to link it with community feedback.   Sensitization workshops have been held with project team members and representatives of local CSOs and communities – and a number of mechanisms will be tested to use the maps to share information and elicit community feedback.  

These terms of reference represent the next step in this effort. By enhancing the map and training community representatives to report on project completion rate and funding received, the map can play a critical role in delivering transparency and social accountability.


## DELIVERABLES/SPECIFIC OUTPUTS EXPECTED FROM CONSULTANT

The assignment will consist of the following development phases.  The consultants are welcome to comment and propose a different approach to implementation of this pilot and the phases laid out below:  

### Deliverable I - (November-March 2013): Design of Web-Based Application and Mobile or Tablet Data Collection Tool.

1. Mobile form customization
2. Transfer Existing Project Data to Maps (Geo-Data Migration)
3.  Create a custom dashboard for project management and data sharing between partners

### Deliverable II – (April 2013): MIS Integration & Final Reporting &  Recommendations for Scaling.

* Analysis of MIS Integration needs
* Exporting collected data out for input into MIS.
* Importing data from MIS (in CSV format) into WKCDD dashboard.

After analyzing the MIS integration needs, export the collected data for input into MIS and import appropriate data from the MIS into the WKCDD dashboard.

Create and submit a final report outlining the full range of work and methodologies deployed including the participatory design process and agile software development processes. This should include photos, lessons learned, stumbling blocks, etc. and suggested steps for scaling up.


## SPECIFIC INPUTS TO BE PRESENTED BY THE CLIENT

### Phase 1
**Mobile form customization**
Development/modification of mobile data collection forms as needed. 

**Geo-Data Migration**
Migration of existing WKCDD mapped project data into new system where continuous mapping of new and existing projects can take place.

**Create a custom dashboard for project management and data sharing between partners**

* Ability to view the locations of each project on a map.  Click on it and view the basic details of the project (including potentially some generated indicators).
* Ability to assign a different type of icon/map marker per project type.  Introduce idea of picking icons and multiple layers per map.
* Ability to view projects filtered by a property (different colours).
* Ability to view the indicators aggregated at a District, County and Sub-County * Level in a data table or chloropleth map
* Hold on data before it is released.  Ability to view and vet data (say for 2 weeks on a monthly report) before it is released to the “live” dashboard.
* Work with WKCDD to program dynamic indicators, which will be generated from the data collection forms.
* Ability to view the indicators on a monthly or quarterly basis. Ability to show changes over time for an indicator at a particular aggregation level.
* Ability to print maps for hand-out to the communities.
* Simple leader board system, allowing you to compare project indicators/scores across projects/regions.  Web based view optimized for mobile.
* Dashboard design localized to WKCDD branding requirements.
General Project Management / Client support

### Phase 2
**MIS Integration**

* Analysis of MIS Integration needs
* Exporting collected data out for input into MIS.
* Importing data from MIS (in CSV format) into WKCDD dashboard.

**Final Reporting & Recommendations for Scaling**

Create and submit a final report outlining the full range of work done on the project. This should include photos, lessons learned, stumbling blocks, etc. and suggested steps for scaling up.

The selected individuals are expected to spend most of the time on the ground Kenya, working closely with the main stakeholders: WB team, Office of the President - Ministry of State for Special Programs, and relevant community-driven development committees (CDDC’s).

As a next step, this map based information system will be also used by project teams as tool to monitor policies implemented to respond citizen demands  in the selected LGs which in turn would provide citizens with tools to monitor and provide feedback on rural upgrading projects and account policy makers.
